            <h1>These are things that I think about.</h1>
            <p>These are some bizarre times to live in. Technology is creating exponentially more information than
                humans have evolved to comprehend. An interesting effect of this seems to be that creating even
                <b>more</b> content makes litte difference, as we are already far past cognitive saturation at this
                point.</p>
            <p>...and so I am collecting my thoughts about things here. This is very much a work-in-progress. Ideally,
                one should focus on as few things as possible. The more goals at one time, the further spread out focus
                ends up being. As such, I wanted to generate a blog with other software, such as <a
                    href="https://www.gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, or a similar static site generator. (<a
                    href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> perhaps?)</p>
            <p>I don't know why, but I kept starting from scratch with HTML and CSS. I'm sure <a
                    href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">Markdown</a> is great. I've used it
                sparingly, and I don't have anything against it, but I kept wanting to use HTML for whatever reason.</p>
            <p>Now, I find myself making a blog site from 'scratch,' while also writing the content for the website. Is
                this an efficient use of time? I really don't know. But I am finding myself working on the website and
                knowing what I want to do, and I think that makes it worthwhile, even if it means I don't get a finished
                product as quickly as I would using a static site generator.</p>
            <p>Then again - is a website ever "finished"? I don't think so. Any project involving code seems to be
                similar to research papers; they aren't ever <b><i>completed</i></b> so much as they are
                <i><b>due</i></b>...</p>
