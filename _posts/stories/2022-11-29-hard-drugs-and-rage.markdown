# Hard Drugs

"The Samurai mask cries tears of blood every time I shoot up." 

This is what my brother says after blasting a rather hefty amount of heroin and cocaine into his right arm. He's visiting from out of town, on holiday from his Army base in the Pacific Northwest. He has some new tattoos, one of which is a Samurai's mask. Its right eye is intentionally inked directly over his median cubital vein, and the mask "...cries tears of blood..." after he pulls the formerly-registered needle out of his arm. Let's call my brother "Ethan."

He's a bit over 6 feet tall, pasty as fuck with sandy-blonde hair and covered in freckles, blue eyes, and looks like he could be a second cousing to Bear Grylls. He's so incredibly white the running joke is that he'd get a sunburn if he fell asleep with the a night-light on.

Ethan wipes the blood off his arm with a piece of tissue. Wadding the paper up into his hands, he chuckles, "It's been way too fucking long. The dope in Orgegon is shite."

He's almost dressed like a civilian. If I'm remembering correctly, he's wearing a black t-shirt with the words Hatebreed emblazoned across the front; blue jeans new enough to still be indigo in color, and a pair of black suede Vans shoes, not yet ruined from skateboard shenanigans. However, he's also wearing an Army-issue tan fatigue jacket when he's not dumping narcotics into his circulation. I guess at least one benefit of touring Afghanistan is that you get a really swank piece of mocha-colored canvas.

He puts his fatigue back on and sits cross-legged on the floor. I have no fucking idea why. There's multiple couches and chairs in our den area.

"You say that like the dope in Colorado is something to write home about." I say, while cooking up my own concoction of white and black. The smell of vinegar and poppy flowers is wafting up from the spoon.

"Besides," I say, "Oregon is right next to Seattle, the birthplace of Grunge, wouldn't that be a great place to get *literally* killer drugs?"

"You'd think so, and maybe it was in the 90s, but the shit there now is so weak. You need to do a full gram in one shot to get anywhere."

"I'll take your word for it I guess. Hand me your belt, please? Thanks."

I tie off my left arm - the preferred arm, as it hits faster than the right - register some blood into the syringe, and blast off myself. Within about 5 seconds, I get the trademark taste of astringent florals in the back of my throat, and the warm fuzzies that nothing - alive, dead, maternal or romantic - has ever been able to match.

We're listening to Nirvana's *In Utero* album. Nirvana is usually the go-to music for speedballs for he and I. Maybe most people these days. It's not *required* to abuse clandestine substances while listening to Grunge, but when in Rome...

"You kill anyone yet?" I say, while dabbing a piece of cotton ball to the crease of my left arm.

"Well, I haven't seen a dead body that I can be sure of. There was a guy firing at us one night, and after we shot off some mortar rounds, one looked like it landed in the right spot. The infra-red camera picked up a torso that wasn't moving any more. Or shooting at us, for that matter."

I crack a twisted smile, "Well, he probably had brown skin, so it's not like you killed someone with a soul or something. Or a family, or anyone important."
