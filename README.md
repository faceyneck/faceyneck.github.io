GitHub Pages website

This took far more effort than I hoped it would. I have a sneaking suspicion this is simply because web devlopment happens so quickly, it is difficult to stay on top of the needed procedures to get a website working.

I registered my domain name with gandi.net, and trying to get it working with GitHub pages (faceyneck.com) was an impressively difficult task that took me a couple days to figure out.
